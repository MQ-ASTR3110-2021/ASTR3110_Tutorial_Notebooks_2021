    "Artifical neural networks (ANNs) are applied as a supervised learning technique to classify data into known classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of them as a cousin of familiar curve-fitting, but taken to higher dimensions. For example, when fitting a polynomial curve to a dataset we learn the values of the coefficients $W$ so that the model curve can accurately predict an outcome given input data. Similarly, for an ANN classifier, we learn a set of weights (coefficients) between the neurons so the the network can accurately predict a label for input training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SegmentLocal](Images/ANN_1layer.svg \"ANN1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases the fitting procedure employs a measure of how well model performs. For curve fitting the distance between the data and model is minimised (e.g., $\\chi^2$ or least-squared distance), while for an ANN classifier a *loss function* is minimised.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the classifier, the loss function desires the following state:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/loss_margin.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores inside the red region (or higher) will accumulate a loss, while scores below will accumulate zero loss.\n",

    "Some articles I found helpful: a high-level description at [this link](https://becominghuman.ai/understanding-neural-networks-1-the-concept-of-neurons-287be36d40f), more detail at [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-neural-networks-19020b758230) and [this link](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html).\n",

    " * Randomly initialise the weights between neurons\n",
    " * assess the performance of the network using the loss function\n",
    " * examine the slope of the loss surface and jump 'down-hill'\n",
    " * rinse and repeat until no improvement is seen\n",
    "\n",
    "![SegmentLocal](Images/grad_descent.gif \"descent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is superficially similar fitting a polynomial curve, however, there are two major differences:\n",
    " 1. the weight coefficients are not independent - the output of neurons are affected by all in the chain before them\n",
    " 1. the very large datasets required by ANNs will not fit in memory\n",
    " \n",
    "The first probem is addressed by back-propagating the gradients using the chain-rule. The second problem is solved by only training on a subset of the data, called a 'mini-batch' (or just 'batch'), and randomly changing the selection of this data every cycle."
